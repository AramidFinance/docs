# Cross-Chain Messaging

Aramid is not limited to token transfers. It supports cross-chain messaging, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to pass arbitrary data between different blockchain networks. This capability is crucial for use cases such as:

- Cross-chain governance, where voting or decision-making processes span multiple blockchains.
- dApp interoperability, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other applications to interact across ecosystems without relying on centralized intermediaries.
