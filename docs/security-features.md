# Security Features

## Decentralized Validation with P2P Communication

The Soldier Nodes communicate over an Algorand-based application-specific chain and have a backup libp2p-based protocol, ensuring that all communication between nodes is decentralized and resistant to centralization risks. Each node independently verifies the validity of transactions, reducing the likelihood of collusion or manipulation.

- **Secure Messaging**: All communication between nodes is cryptographically secured, preventing eavesdropping or tampering by malicious actors.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The decentralized nature of the Soldier Network ensures that the protocol remains resilient even if individual nodes go offline or are compromised.

## Transaction Finality and Resilience

Aramid's bridge utilizes a lock-and-release mechanism to ensure the secure transfer of tokens between chains. When a user locks tokens on the source chain, the Soldiers validate the transaction and execute the corresponding release on the destination chain.

- **Automated Retry Mechanism**: The system can automatically retry failed transactions, ensuring that users do not lose funds due to temporary failures in the release process.
- **Transaction Reprocessing**: In case of transaction failure during the release phase, Soldier Nodes can automatically reprocess the transaction. If automatic reprocessing fails, manual intervention through governance can recover tokens.
