# Fee Structure

## Aramid Fee

Aramid employs a 0.1% fixed fee model for all bridging transactions, ensuring transparency and predictability for users, regardless of network conditions or transaction size.

## Gas Fees

In addition to the fixed fee, users must also pay network gas fees to cover the cost of executing the transaction on the specific blockchain. These gas fees are determined by the underlying blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum) and can fluctuate based on:

- Network congestion
- Transaction complexity
