# Governance and Upgradability

The protocol is governed by a set of on-chain governance contracts that allow for the addition or removal of Soldier Nodes, adjustment of signature thresholds, and deployment of new features or contract upgrades. These governance contracts are secured by the multi-signature process, ensuring that any changes to the protocol are decentralized and consensus-driven.

## Threshold Governance

The number of signatures required for governance actions can be dynamically adjusted, with the system ensuring that key decisions (such as adding new chains or modifying fee structures) are always made by a majority or supermajority of Soldier Nodes.

## Upgradeable Contracts

Aramid uses a proxy pattern for its smart contracts, allowing for upgrades without requiring users to migrate to new contracts. This ensures continuous improvements without disrupting the user experience.
