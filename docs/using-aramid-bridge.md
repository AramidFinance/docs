# How to Use the Aramid Bridge

The Aramid Bridge enables users to transfer assets between supported networks with ease. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you bridge your assets securely.

## 3.1 Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Go to the Aramid Bridge Interface
   Navigate to the Aramid Bridge platform.
2. Select the Origin Chain
   Choose the blockchain network where your assets are currently held (e.g., Ethereum, Voi Network, etc.).
3. Select the Asset to Bridge
   Choose the token or asset you wish to bridge.
4. Connect Your Origin Wallet
   Connect your wallet associated with the origin chain. For Voi Network, you can use the Kibisis Wallet.
5. Enter the Amount to Bridge
   Specify the amount of the selected asset to bridge.
6. Select the Destination Chain
   Choose the network where you want to receive the assets (e.g., Arbitrum, Algorand, etc.).
7. Confirm the Destination Asset
   Ensure that the correct asset is selected for receipt on the destination chain.
8. Connect the Destination Wallet
   For EVM chains, connect the destination wallet to sign the claim transaction. For AVM chains, you can alternatively enter a destination address manually.
9. Optional: Add a Note/Memo
   You can add an optional note or payment reference for transaction tracking. This is not required but may be useful for record-keeping.
10. Review the Transaction
    Verify all transaction details, including origin chain, destination chain, and asset amount.
11. Approve and Sign the Transaction
    For AVM chains: Click Sign and follow the signature instructions in your wallet.
    For EVM chains: Click Approve & Sign and follow the approval process.
12. Wait for the Transfer to Complete
    Bridging typically takes under 3 minutes, depending on network conditions.
13. Claim the Assets
    Once the bridge process is complete, click Claim and follow the signature instructions in your destination wallet (for EVM chains).
14. Bridge Again
    If you need to transfer more assets, click Bridge Again to start a new process.
