# Using Aramid Bridge

The Aramid Bridge enables users to transfer assets between supported networks with ease. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you bridge your assets securely.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Go to the [Aramid Bridge](https://app.aramid.finance)
2. Choose your Origin chain.
3. Choose your Bridge asset. 
4. Connect your Origin wallet.
5. Enter your Amount to bridge.
6. Choose your Destination chain.
7. Confirm your Receive asset is correct.
8. Connect your Destination wallet. 
You can alternatively enter a Destination address if bridging to an AVM network. 
**EVM Destination chains require a connected wallet to sign the claim transaction.** 
9. **Optional:** Enter your Note/Memo/Payment ****reference. 
This is not required for bridging but can be useful to keep track of transactions with on-chain messages.
10. Click “Review your transaction”.
11. Confirm the details of your transaction.
12. Click “Sign”(AVM) or “Approve & Sign”(EVM) and follow the signature instructions in your Origin wallet.
13. Wait for Aramid to bridge your assets, this usually takes less than 3 minutes.
14. Click “Claim” and follow the signature instructions in your Destination wallet.
**AVM Destination chains do not require any further transactions.** 
15. Congratulations, you have travelled across the Aramid Bridge🥳
Click “Bridge again” if you would like to move assets cross-chain again.

## Important Considerations

- **Gas Fees**: Each transaction requires gas fees on both the source and destination chains.
- **Minimum Transfer Amounts**: There may be minimum transfer amounts to ensure the transaction value exceeds the gas costs.
- **Network Congestion**: During high traffic periods, transactions may take longer to process.
- **Asset Availability**: Not all assets are available on all chains. Check the supported assets list before initiating a transfer.
